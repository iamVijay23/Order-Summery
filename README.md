## Overview
The Order Summary Component is a HTML and CSS challenge that involves designing a responsive and visually appealing card to display an overview of a user's order. It typically includes sections for product details, total cost, and action buttons. The challenge requires translating a provided design into HTML code and applying CSS styling to achieve the desired visual design. The component should be structured using appropriate HTML tags and styled with properties such as background color, font styles, spacing, and borders. The end result should be a user-friendly and responsive order summary card for e-commerce websites or checkout pages
